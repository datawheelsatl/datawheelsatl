- 👋 Hi, I’m @datawheelsatl
- 👀 I’m interested in in taking what I know, and new things that I learn along the way to build projects to put on my resume and build my portfolio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analytics, Tableau,SQL, and machine learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost any project.  I'm a beginner, but I've been fluent with computer technology since the birth of MSDOS, so I catch on quite fast!
- 📫 How to reach me timothywheelspro@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I know alot of independant artists, djs, and entrepreneurs.  I'm a writer with a concentration focused in poetry.  Eager to apply my writing skills in other settings as well.
